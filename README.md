This repo is the result of module coursework on analog and  digital circuits, computer architecture, and programming, in which the learning purpose were  to  analyse and design electronic circuits with a system level perspective.

The aim of this coursework was to provide theoretical foundations on design techniques and hands-on experiences of acquiring physical analog signals, pre-processing them, converting them into digital form, then processing these in digital programmable hardware on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Emphasis was made on the non-ideal electronic hardware, which confronts us to overcome practical challenges such as noisy signal processing. 

The following skills were acquired by the end of the course:

>build working amplifier circuits with real-life op-amps

>analyse and predict behaviour of active filters

>explain limitations of op-amp from datasheets

>analyse the operation of synchronous digital systems

>synthesize a synchronous digital system to meet a specification

>determine the worst-case propagation delay of a combinational circuit

>evaluate the performance of A/D and D/A conversion circuits

>design arithmetic circuits to meet a specification and determine the propagation delay

>design of finite state machines

>design using Verilog HDL
